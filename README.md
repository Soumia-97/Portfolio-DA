# Soumia Zarkan - Data Analyst Portfolio 

Welcome on my portfolio ! Here you'll find a collection of my most recent work on data analytics.

# Who am I ? üîç

**Hello, I'm Soumia!** I recently graduated with a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence and Business Analytics. I'm passionate about data science and emerging technologies, and I‚Äôm currently seeking my first professional opportunity as a data analyst. My academic journey has given me a strong foundation in data analysis, predictive modeling, and AI, which I have applied through several significant projects showcased in this portfolio.

Throughout my studies, I developed a keen ability to work with complex data, identify trends, and solve strategic problems using AI. In addition to my technical skills, I have gained a solid understanding of business challenges, allowing me to bridge the gap between data science and concrete business objectives.

## üìö Projects

### Project 1:  _Netflix recommendation system_ üé•
<p align="justify"> 
<strong>Description</strong> : We wanted to develop a new movie recommendation engine for the clients. Recommendation engines are widely used by market leaders to enhance user engagement and retention. By analyzing data from similar users, these systems provide personalized recommendations that align with users' preferences. When users receive content they enjoy, they tend to spend more time on the platform, which directly helps reduce customer churn. For instance, Netflix‚Äôs recommendation algorithms are a prime example, generating approximately $1 billion in value annually from customer retention efforts alone (2019).

<p align="justify"> 
<strong>Description</strong> : We were are tasked with addressing a new challenge: creating a recommendation system designed to encourage customers to purchase games that align with their preferences. This system will be built upon identifying similar games to those already chosen by users, enabling them to discover and buy games that truly match their interests and needs.

### Project 4:  _Chatbot for Skyscanner_ ‚úàÔ∏è
<p align="justify"> 
<strong>Description</strong> : Skyscanner is an online platform for comparing flights, hotels, and car rentals, enabling users to explore offers from over a thousand providers to find the cheapest, shortest, or most eco-friendly flights. Users can also identify the most affordable month or day to travel and set up price alerts to book at the best time. Our goal is to implement a user-friendly interface and an efficient chatbot that assists users in navigating the website, providing accurate and helpful answers to enhance their experience.
